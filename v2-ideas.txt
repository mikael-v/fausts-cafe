IDEAS FOR 2ND VERSION:

- turn nav into a pop-out sidebar
- make the header sticky scroll and background color only appears when scroll down, otherwise it's part of the page 
(like https://muffingroup.com/blog/cafe-websites/)
- maybe add a feedback form and/or a form to book a table
- turn menu in header into a dropdown linking seperately to food, drink & desserts
- make a review carousel with npc & pc character profile images
- make the food link to an informational page/image about each item (look at gelato village website for inspiration)
